##  FAQ
  * Content blockers are usually limited to a specific browser and have much less powerful ad-fighting tools. AdGuard for Android is a standalone app that can block ads and trackers in both browsers and apps. Its filtering quality is much better.
  * Google Play doesn’t allow apps that can block ads across the device. This policy only leaves room for browser-specific content blockers. That’s why AdGuard, a full-featured ad blocker for Android, [was removed](https://adguard.com/en/blog/google-removes-adguard-android-app-google-play.html) from the store.
  * The free version is excellent at removing ads from browsers, but it can’t filter apps and doesn’t have features like Browsing Security, Tracking protection, and Userscripts. To enjoy the advanced features that will help you block trackers and dangerous websites, [get the paid version](https://adguard.com/en/license.html).
  * Visit our [Knowledge base](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-android/installation/) to learn how to install AdGuard Ad Blocker for Android.


  * To learn more about the key features of AdGuard for Android and how to get rid of ads on your device, read [our Knowledge base article](https://adguard.com/kb/adguard-for-android/overview/).
  * No, you don’t. Unlike many other ad blockers, AdGuard uses a so-called local VPN to block ads on non-rooted devices.
  * You can easily use AdGuard with [AdGuard VPN](https://adguard-vpn.com/welcome.html?_plc=en). Their integration is automatically enabled once both apps are up and running.
As for third-party VPN apps, there may be problems. AdGuard Ad Blocker runs a local VPN on your device to filter properly. Android doesn't allow running two VPNs at the same time, but there are workarounds. For rooted devices, we recommend switching AdGuard to Automatic proxy. This will allow your device to use another VPN app.
Also, VPNs like PIA VPN or Nord VPN allow you to use an upstream proxy — check if your VPN has this option.
  * If you have any questions, you can contact us 24/7 at support@adguard.com. It’s a good idea to check [our FAQ](https://adguard.com/en/support/adguard_for_android.html) first: it contains answers to 90% of user questions.

To perform filtering, AdGuard installs its network driver. If you decide to use [HTTPS filtering](https://adguard.com/kb/general/https-filtering/what-is-https-filtering/), AdGuard will generate a unique root certificate and install it in the system. All changes made by AdGuard in the system will be reset after uninstalling the app

Browsers
AdGuard "intercepts" the traffic of your browsers and leads it via its own filtering engine. Chrome, Firefox or any browser you like — you don't need to install any specific extensions to block ads there. AdGuard program works EVERYWHERE. (Although, you might want to additionally install AdGuard Browser Assistant — a small extension to the program to help you manage the filtering right in the browser).
Apps
Being a full-fledged software AdGuard is not limited in technical capabilities (while most ad blocking extensions are) and can filter outside browsers as well. AdGuard "intercepts" the traffic of all apps and leads it via its own filtering engine, so that you get them free of ads and trackers.
System
Operating system might sometimes track you and collect all kinds of telemetry (a bunch of diagnostic data). AdGuard can also prevent this.
DNS filtering
AdGuard intercepts DNS requests and can block them if it is an address of a known advertising or tracking server that is being requested. AdGuard can also automatically encrypt your DNS traffic.
Network filtering
AdGuard needs to work on a network level to control all apps on your device. To do so, we use a special network driver, which activates the actual transmission and receipt of data over the network.
HTTPS filtering
The encrypted connections are filtered right on your device. To do that, AdGuard generates a unique root certificate and installs it in the system. Then, each connection is decrypted and trackers and ads are removed locally. The connection is encrypted again for the "communication" with the server. No unencrypted data ever leaves your device. [Learn more here](https://adguard.com/kb/general/https-filtering/what-is-https-filtering/).
Content filtering
AdGuard filters the content of web pages and removes all tracking and advertising requests from there. In browsers, it also applies additional cosmetic rules when blocking or hiding advertising elements (so that you see a nicely processed page rather than just blank spaces where ads just were).
World Wide Web
Next, websites or apps are connecting to the servers on the Internet. As all tracking and advertising requests were blocked, you don't connect to them. Thus, you get ad-free, safe, fast (as there are no extra elements to load) Web, and also save traffic.
