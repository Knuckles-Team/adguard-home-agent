[ AdGuard ](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html)Terms of Sale
# Terms of Sale
## General information
Upon making a purchase, Customer pays for a license key that allows them to activate AdGuard on the corresponding number of devices and for a certain amount of time.
Our order process is carried out by our online resellers, including Paddle.com, who serve as Merchants of Record for our orders. These resellers handle customer service inquiries and manage returns. The order process is conducted using one of the Merchants of Record. Depending on the selected currency of the user, it can be [Paddle.com](https://www.paddle.com/) or [PayPro Global](https://payproglobal.com/).
## Payment options
Payment options depend on the user's location and may include any of the following:
  * Credit card
  * Apple Pay
  * PayPal
  * Google Pay
  * Alipay
  * Сryptocurrency


## Refund policy
All our products offer trial periods, and we encourage our Customers to try it for free before purchasing to ensure they meet their expectations.
We grant our customers a possibility to return 100% of funds they spent on AdGuard license keys purchased from <https://adguard.com> (for license keys purchased elsewhere, look for the refund policy of that particular reseller). All full refund requests made within 60 days since the license key purchase are satisfied no matter what the reason is. The license key in question becomes blocked the moment the refund is issued. After 60 days, all requests are considered individually and the decision whether to issue a refund is left up to AdGuard Software Ltd.
We do not grant partial refunds for license keys' upgrades and prolongations. Each case of partial refund request is discussed separately between Customer and Support, and satisfied only upon mutual agreement.
## How to request a refund
To get a refund for the license key(s) purchased on the official website <https://adguard.com>, you need to contact the support team: support@adguard.com.
Processing time will depend on the payment method you have chosen and usually takes up to 5–10 business days.
## Auto-renewal
The auto-renewal feature is turned on by default, so the funds will be withdrawn from your account and the AdGuard license will be renewed automatically when the previous period expires.
You can cancel auto-renewal at any time and at no additional cost in the [AdGuard account](https://adguardaccount.com/account/licenses) to which the AdGuard license is bound. Your paid license will still be valid until the end of its term, but you will need to manually renew it when it expires.
## Special offers
Discounts apply only to the first term of the license, i.e. 1 year. When a license purchased with a discount expires, the payment for the subscription renewal will be charged at full price.
## Merchant information
ADGUARD SOFTWARE LIMITED is a company registered in Anexartesias and Athinon 79, Nora Court Flat/Office 203-205, 3040 Limassol, Cyprus.
