[ AdGuard for Linux 1.0 ![](https://cdn.adguardcdn.com/website/adguard.com/svg/anchor-link.svg) ](https://adguard.com/en/versions/linux/release.html#version-1016)
Release date: April 29, 2025
This release marks the beginning of something huge: AdGuard for Linux is here to give our Linux users the protection AdGuard is known and trusted for, now on their OS!
For years, Linux users have been asking for their own version of AdGuard — that’s why we’ve poured our time and energy into making the Linux experience a powerful one. With AdGuard v1.0 for Linux, you now have access to a broad range of features and a complete, flexible way to stay protected on Linux.
If you tested [AdGuard v1.0 for Linux nightly](https://adguard.com/en/blog/adguard-for-linux-nightly.html), you’ll love the stable version — it adds even more features to enhance performance and usability.
### App exclusions
This feature drastically improves the usability of AdGuard for Linux. If you’re not familiar with it yet — it lets you selectively route traffic from specific apps, skipping AdGuard’s filtering when you don’t need it. Whether you’re troubleshooting or just want to keep seeing the ads from a certain service, this can come in handy.
And to make your life even easier, we’ve put together two pre-built lists of browsers and apps to be excluded from HTTPS filtering — so setting up exclusions is faster and way less manual.
The list can be edited in the files `proxy.yaml` (for app exclusions) and `browsers.yaml` (for browser exclusions). You can edit them using the built-in terminal editor (or any other text editor) by entering `nano [path to the file]`, and then restart the protection. To see the location of the file, check the output of the `config` command.
### Differential filter update
In this version, we have replaced the filter update method with a differential one. To put it simply, instead of fetching the entire filter list, AdGuard for Linux will only download the changes that were made to the list since the last update. Less traffic will be spent on updating and filters will be updated faster. You will always have the most current versions of filters and a more accurate ad blocking.
