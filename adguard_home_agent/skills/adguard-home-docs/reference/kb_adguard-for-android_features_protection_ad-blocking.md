# Ad blocking
This article is about AdGuard for Android, a multifunctional ad blocker that protects your device at the system level. To see how it works, [download the AdGuard app](https://agrd.io/download-kb-adblock)
The Ad blocking module can be accessed by tapping the _Protection_ tab (second-left icon at the bottom of the screen) and then selecting _Ad blocking_.
The feature blocks ads by applying ad-blocking and language-specific filters. To learn about the mechanism of ad blocking, you can read a [dedicated article](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/how-ad-blocking-works/).
Basic protection effectively blocks ads on most websites. For more customized ad blocking, you can:
  * Enable appropriate language-specific filters — they contain filtering rules for blocking ads on websites in specific languages
  * Add websites to allowlist — these websites won't be filtered by AdGuard
  * Create user rules — AdGuard will apply them on specified websites. [Learn how to create your own user rules](https://adguard.com/kb/general/ad-filtering/create-own-filters/)
