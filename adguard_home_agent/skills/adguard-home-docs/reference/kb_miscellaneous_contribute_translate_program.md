# AdGuard translation program
You can ask us any questions about translating AdGuard by sending an email to translate@adguard.com or by joining our [Telegram chat](https://t.me/joinchat/UVYTLcHbr8JmOGIy).
When it comes to translations, we at AdGuard always heavily rely on volunteers.
We now use the [Crowdin platform](https://crowdin.com/) to manage translations of our products. So this is the place for anyone who wants to contribute to AdGuard by translating any of our products.
If you want to be among the volunteers who help us translate AdGuard, please read the information on [how to become our translator](https://adguard.com/kb/miscellaneous/contribute/translate/become-translator/) and [how we collaborate with them](https://adguard.com/kb/miscellaneous/contribute/translate/rewards/).
